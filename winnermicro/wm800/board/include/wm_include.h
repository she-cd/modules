 *
 * This will download image which includes secboot
 * & user application image into flash by ROM using xmodem-protocol for factory burning.
 * @code
 * Pulling down the bootmode pin(PA0) and reset the device. Then UART0 will output:
 * CCC...
 * For details,please refer to the sdk manual.
 * @endcode
 *
 * Download the "w800.img" image
 *
 * This will download image which only includes user application using xmodem-protocol.
